It comes three. This is the third test post. It will allow me to test pagination easier. Also tag styles.  
Oh, and I know tag links are broken T_T" I will fix that when I start working in local.

For now, I am only working on layouts, since that will make my life easier in the future.  
I will only have to write markdown here! Yay! I suppose that is the point.  
I should pause this and resume my python lesson and exercises tho.
